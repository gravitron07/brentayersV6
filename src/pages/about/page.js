						<div className="contentLeft">
							<p className="tagline">I specialize in front end design/development, flawless code, and standards compliant websites and applications.</p>
							<p className="contentBlock">Iâ€™ve been creating websites and applications in the Atlanta Area for about 15 years now. I strive to make every site I make not only visually appealing, but useable and engaging for everyone that sees it. You can rest assured that the final product I deliver will be scalable so that as your business grows, your site can too.</p>

							<h3 className="contentHead">My Background</h3>
							<p className="contentBlock">I'm a web designer/front-end developer residing in Atlanta, Georgia with my wife and three daughters. I have been building websites and front end applications for over a decade and I think I'm getting pretty good at it.</p>

							<h3 className="contentHead">Where I've Been</h3>
							<p className="contentBlock">I started designing websites professionally in 2000 at Fidelity National Information Solutions. While at Fidelity, I designed real estate websites for RE/MAX, Keller Williams, Realty Executives, and Century 21. After leaving Fidelity in 2004, I went the agency route and worked on some really cool projects for various clients around Atlanta. After a brief stint as a contractor I was offered an amazing opportunity to come work as a front-end developer on WebMD's strategic initiatives team, and ultimately settled in to lead the mobile web development team. I left WebMD in 2012 and I am now a development lead at The Home Depot, where I get to enjoy the break neck pace of online retail selling LOTS of hammers and nails.</p>
